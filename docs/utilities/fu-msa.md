Usage:
    full [options] <MSAFILE>
  
  Keys:
    Scroll Horizontally     Left and Right arrow
      By 10 bases           L, K
      By 100 bases          ShiftL, ShiftK
      To the beginning      1
      To middle parts       2..9
      To the end            0

    Scroll Vertically       A, Up Arrow/ Z, Down Arrow
      Jump to top           ShiftA, PageUp
      Jump to bottom        ShiftZ, PageDown

    Rotate color scheme     Tab
    Refresh screen          F5
    Resize seq labels       -,+
    Search                  / (seqname, ":INT", "#SEQ")
    Quit                    Q, CtrlC

  Options:
    -m, --mouse               Enable mouse
    -n, --norefresh           Disable autorefresh
    -j, --jumpsize INT        Jump size (big jump is 10X) [default: 10]

  Visualization settings:
    -i, --seqindex INT        Start visualization at this sequence [default: 0]
    -p, --seqpos INT          Start visualization at this nucleotide [default: 0]
    -w, --label-width INT     Sequence label width [default: 20]
    -s, --setting-string STR  Settings string (overrrides all other settings) is in the
                              format Seq:{seqindex}:{seqpos}:{labelwidth} and is the 
                              return value of the program when it is closed.

## Keyboard 

#### Horizontal scrolling

* :arrow_left:, :arrow_up: : scroll by one nucleotide
* `K`, `L`: scroll left and right respectively, by 10 nucleotides
* `Shift + K`, `Shift + L`: scroll left and right respectively, by 100 nucleotides
* `End`: Move to sequence end
* `Home`: Move to the beginning of the sequence
* `1`: Move to the first base
* `2`..`9`: Move to 20% .. 90% of the sequence
* `0`: Move to the last base

#### Vertical scrolling

* `A`, `Z` and :arrow_up:, :arrow_down: : Move up and down by one sequence
* `Shift + A`, `Shift + Z`: Move to top and move to bottom

#### Search

* `/` Trigger search, then:
  * Type the query
  * Hit `Enter` to submit or `Esc` to abort

* The query can be:
  * part of a sequence name
  * `:` followed by a sequence index (eg: `:0` to go to the first sequence)
  * `#` followed by a sequence (eg: `#ATTAC` to jump to the position of the first occurrence of ATTAC)
  
#### Visualization

* `Space`: toggle consensus sequence from "Consensus" (show bases identical across all the sequences) to "Majority" (show bases shared by 50% of the sequences or more)
* `Tab`: toggle color scheme
* `-`,`+`: Decrease and increase by one the sequence label width
* `F5`, `R`: refresh 
* `F6`: toggle autorefresh on/off
* `H`: toggle help screen (only major keys are reported)

#### Mouse

* `M`: toggle mouse on/off
* When mouse is on:
  * Click in a nucleotide to set that position as first (scroll right)
  * Click to the sequence name area (left) to scroll left

### Resuming session

When pressing quit (`Q`) the program will print a configuration string like: `Seq:0:6:20`
that can be used to resume the session at the same position with:

```bash
fu-msa {input_file} --setting-string Seq:0:6:20
```

The settings string is in the format `Seq:{seqindex}:{seqpos}:{labelwidth}`

### Colors

* DNA: `A` (red), `C` (cyan), `G` (green), `T` (yellow)
* Protein: ["Lesk" scheme](https://www.bioinformatics.nl/~berndb/aacolour.html):
  * Hydrophobic, green
  * Small non polar, yellow (should be orange)
  * Polar, magenta
  * Negative charge, red
  * Positive charge, cyan (should be blue)
